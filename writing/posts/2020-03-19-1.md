## #WFH #COVID-19

Working from home is actually going pretty well. Maybe I'm slightly less focused than on usual WFH days, because there's so much happening right now, but the fact that everything else is on lockdown and cancelled is also giving me a lot more time to work.

I'm getting in more sleep, can work more flexible hours and because there's no commute, I actually have the time and energy for my own projects at night as well ðŸ™Œ

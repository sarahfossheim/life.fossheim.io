Being home 24/7 also means I've had more time to cook, and because we've been trying to minimize our trips to the grocery store we've actually been doing some proper meal planning as well. So I've had some really good food lately.

- [Sambar](https://www.vegrecipesofindia.com/sambhar-recipe-a-method-made-easy/), a South-Indian lentil stew. We had this so often during our trip in Kerala, and I've been making it at home on a regular basis these days as well. It goes well together with [dosa](https://www.thespruceeats.com/how-to-make-dosa-1957716), although I usually just have it with rice.

- [Veg kolhapuri](https://www.vegrecipesofindia.com/veg-kolhapuri-recipe/), another Indian dish. It's vegetables with a really nice and hot spice blend. One of my favorites.

- [Vegan stoofvlees](https://wateetjedanwel.nl/patatje-vegan-stoofvlees/), a typical Belgian dish but then vegan. The recipe is in Dutch, so tldr: boil some vegetables and vegan meat replacement in brown beer, flour, tomato paste, mustard and herbs over a longer period of time and serve with fries.

- [Macarons](https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/step-by-step-guide-to-french-macarons/). My girlfriend has been making a lot of macarons lately, and I cannot stop eating them. It takes a bit of work to make, but it's **SO** worth it ðŸ˜‹

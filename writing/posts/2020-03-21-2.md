## Parties, the corona way

We tried something new last night and grabbed drinks with friends digitally, using the facebook video call feature. And it worked surprisingly well.

Sure, it's maybe not the same as hanging out irl, but it's a pretty great alternative given the circumstances. No one had to go out, no worrying about hand washing or keeping distance, no risk to infect eachother, and everyone could join or leave the call whenever.

I think we'll definitely do this again. üç∫

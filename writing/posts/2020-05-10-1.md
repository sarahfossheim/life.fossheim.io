Besides being **really busy** with a big project at work the past month, I've also been re-creating a few more [objects in CSS](https://codepen.io/collection/nwzQJq).

First I recreated a [Macintosh](https://fossheim.io/writing/posts/css-macintosh/), which took off quite a bit. Afterwards, I worked on a [Braun radio](https://codepen.io/fossheim/pen/OJypZve) designed by Dieter Rams. And last week I made [Nintendo Switch](https://codepen.io/fossheim/pen/jObGxQQ) on livestream.

I have a backlog of similar projects, and I'm actually aiming to stream the majority of them on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/sarahfossheim), it's been very fun letting people in on my process ☀️.

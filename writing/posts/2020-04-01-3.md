## Still on lockdown, still travelling...

... through Animal Crossing! This game could not have been released at a better time. While Norway and the rest of the world are still on lockdown, I still managed to meet (local and far-away) friends by visiting their Animal Crossing islands.

Initially when the game was announced I didn't think I would enjoy its online features this much, but given the current situation I've been using them a whole lot. ðŸ¥°
